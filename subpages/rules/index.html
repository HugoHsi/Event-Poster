	<p>
Some of you may not know the rules to badminton to heart, but that’s okay! Badminton is a very simple sport in that the goal is straightforward. Keep the birdie in the air and don’t let it touch the ground on you’re side of the court. <br /><br />

Boundaries - Depending on if you’re playing singles or doubles, the boundaries may be different. For singles, the inner line on the sides and the outer line in the back are the boundaries. For doubles, all of the boundaries are the outer lines, except when you serve, during which, you must serve past the service line (parallel and closest to the net) and must be within the inner line on the back.<br /><br />

Though the rules are quite simple, complex strategies can definitely be made. Experiment and have fun!
